note over browser:
the brower has already executed the spa.js that has GET 
in the previous step.
This is important as all the logic of how the form behaves
is in there.
end note


note over browser:
when the form is submitted, 
the server does not response with the HTML code, 
instead the script spa.json is triggered so it fetches 
the form-element from the page, prevent the default 
handling of form submit and adds the new note into the 
already existing list and in the end
send a post request to new_note_spa with the following json content:
{content: "heyyyyy", date: "2022-08-20T20:55:03.603Z"}
end note

browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa



server-->browser: response {"message":"note created"}
